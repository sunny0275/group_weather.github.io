## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name
   cd weather-app
   ```

2. **Configure API Keys**
   - Open `script.js`
   - Locate the configuration section at the top:
     ```javascript
     const API_KEY = 'your_openweathermap_api_key';
     const BASE_URL = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5';
     const HOURLY_ITEMS_TO_SHOW = 24;
     ```
   - Replace `'your_openweathermap_api_key'` with your OpenWeatherMap API key
   - Get your API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)

3. **Set Up Google Analytics**
   - In `index.html`, locate the GA4 tracking code:
     ```html
     <!-- Google Analytics 4 -->
     <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-1RKT6F7578"></script>
     <script>
         window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
         function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
         gtag('js', new Date());
         gtag('config', 'G-1RKT6F7578');
     </script>
     ```
   - Replace `G-1RKT6F7578` with your GA4 tracking ID

4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**

   ```bash
   # Initialize git repository (if not already done)
   git init

   # Add all files
   git add .

   # Commit your changes
